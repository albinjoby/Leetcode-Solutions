# Leetcode-Solutions

Welcome to the **Leetcode-Solutions** repository! ðŸŽ¯

This repository contains all the LeetCode problems I have solved, with the corresponding code implementations.

## Structure

Each problem is stored in its own directory, named after the problem's title and ID.


## Languages

All solutions in this repository are written in **Python**.

## LeetSync Integration

I am using [LeetSync](https://github.com/synleets/leetsync) to automatically sync my solutions from LeetCode to this repository. The time and memory usage metrics for each solution are also tracked and displayed alongside each problem.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**:  
   Clone the repository to your local machine using the command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-NAME/Leetcode-Solutions.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to a Problem**:  
   Go into the directory of the problem you are interested in:
   ```
   cd Leetcode-Solutions/189-rotate-array/
   ```

3. **View the Solution**:  
   Open the `solution.py` file to view the code implementation. There is an `explanation.md` file, you can open it to understand the approach.
